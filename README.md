# Coronavirus Toilet Paper Shortage Bullshit

*my rant on people buying all the toilet paper in stores and how we are handling the situation*

This is my rant on what I see on social media where people are stockpiling and even fighitng over rolls of TP. Seriously, what the **FUCK**. These people are out there fighting and almost killing eachother over TP, when in reality, if they should buy things, it should be food and water. I mean seriously, what the hell are you going to do with all that toilet paper for, besides building a fort out of it. Some reason why I think its dumb is because of

* it prevents others from buying it
* it wastes your money on essential things you  need
* you look like an idiot


If you really need that many rolls, then you probably need to go to the hospital anyways. And what are you going to do about food? You managed to spend all of your money on an 18 month supply of toilet paper, however, you dont have any money left to buy any food or medicine, or even gasoline.

And what about how governments are taking care of the situation. Some are taking extreme measures to contain the virus, while others are fucking lying or doing whatever the hell they're doing. This fucking virus is so much of a cunt, it can hide in the body ranging from 14 to up to 24 days without any symptoms showing. We should've been taking care of this the first it came onto our radars back in January when i still could've been maintained. I mean, take a look at this map on the number of symptoms as of today compared to the beginning of this situation.
